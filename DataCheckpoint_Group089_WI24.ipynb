    "Nearly a billion people fly in the US alone every year, with the exception of covid. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Given how prevalent air travel is, we decided to conduct a deeper analysis on airline pricing. We decided to look at LAX specifically given that it is one of the busiest airports in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tons of research has gone into examining different airline pricing strategies and factors that affect the cost of an air fare. In general, airlines, much like other businesses, cater their products toward different demographics of customers. People that travel for work or business are typically more flexible in regards to how they fly as well as less price-sensitve in comparison to leisure travelers.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) By taking advantage of this fact, airline companies are able to effectively segment their products which allows them to maximize their revenues. Airlines also take advantage of dynamic pricing algorithms to match fluctuations in demand. While demand does have some random variation, cyclical factors such as time of day, day of the week or season, play a huge role in the price of an airfare.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) These pricing algorithms are able to capitalize on these flucations in demand and change the price of a ticket accordingly. Other strategies used by airlines include overbooking, poaching, etc.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We believe that the factors that most significantly impact the price of a basic economy flight from LAX to other major U.S airports is the difference between the flight date and search date, and total distance/travel duration to desination. From our research, we learned that the price of airline tickets gets higher the closer you book to the flight date since the number of available seats decreases over time. Finally, the further or longer (in terms of time) a plane has to fly, the more costs will be incurred in gasoline and labor costs for staff, so we would expect that further flights are more expensive."

We wil analysis which variable effects our baseFare and totalFare.Our most inportant varaibles would be baseFare and totalFare. These will be our dependeent varaibles, we will see which variables which are included in the dataset affect our dependent variables. This will help us determine which factors significantly affect the pricing of basic economy domestic flights from LAX to major U.S. To make the data more useable and cleaner, we will eliminate flights with missing information, convert any strings to numeric if necessary, and have consistence data on every flight in the dataset. We can potential apply linear regression to see what affects our dependent variable.  "
